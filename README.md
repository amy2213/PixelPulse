# Pixel Pulse Analytics Resource Library

Welcome to the Pixel Pulse Analytics Resource Library! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and organized collection of resources for non-traditional pathways into tech, with a focus on data, AI, research, and lifelong learning.

## About

Pixel Pulse Analytics is dedicated to helping individuals navigate the world of technology through non-traditional learning pathways. We provide insights into various learning programs, certifications, and resources to support your journey into tech.

## My Journey

My journey started with Amazon in 2017. After working there for two years, I took advantage of their Career Choice program. One day, I saw a poster for Merit America in a bathroom stall, and that moment changed my life. Career Choice paid for my entire Merit America program, where I earned my Google IT Support Certification and learned valuable skills such as networking, resume writing, and more. Merit America introduced me to Career Circle, which then connected me to TEKsystems, where I worked from 2019 to 2024.
